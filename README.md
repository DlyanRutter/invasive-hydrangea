Hydrangea are an invasive species of flower. The purpose of this project is to detect them using image recognition.
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/invasive-species-monitoring/data
Necessary modules will include tensorflow, numpy, Scikit-learn, h5py, keras, matplotlib, opencv, random, pandas, math, time,
argparse, and inspect. I will be makeing two separate models. One using TensorFlow, and one using Keras. I aim to compare their log loss and accuracy
